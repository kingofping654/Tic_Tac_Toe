# Tic_Tac_Toe
A small Tic Tac Toe game you can play against another person or the computer. The computer is pretty dumb though...

I actually had a lot of fun coding this project. I figured out the whole using a hash for the board pretty quickly and from that point it was pretty smooth. 
I did admitedly have a little trouble whith some of the logic for winning and losing. My biggest problems came from small spelling mistakes and forgeting how loops work. I made the computer controlled version after I was on a run and figured out it would be really simple to add a computer who just picks spots randomly from the remaining open spots. After implementing the random method I gave it a little logic to make decisions based on the first players move. As a lifelong fan of video games this was a fun way to get a very simple idea of how programing an enemy would work. When I figure out how it would be fun to give this a GUI and put it in my portfolio.
